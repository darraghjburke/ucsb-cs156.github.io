# Linting your react code

To check your code for style issues, you can use `eslint`.

Install it with `npm install eslint --save-dev` then run this command, where `directory` is a directory containing
your React code:

```
npx eslint directory
```

Be careful that you don't run eslint on code in a `build` directory (i.e. the generated JavaScript); you only want to run it on your JavaScript source code.

If you get the error:

```
Error: Failed to load parser '@typescript-eslint/parser'...
```

then, try installing `typescript` manually:

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```
