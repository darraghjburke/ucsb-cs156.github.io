# Quick One Liners

Replace foo with bar in every .java file in current directory (based on [this source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11392478/how-to-replace-a-string-in-multiple-files-in-linux-command-line))  (Does NOT WORK ON MAC... see below for alternate version).


```
cd /path/to/your/folder
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' *.java
```

Note that on Mac, the second line should be:

```
sed -i .backup -e 's/foo/bar/g' *.java
```

Replace old-word with new-word in every file in current directory tree (based on [this source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11392478/how-to-replace-a-string-in-multiple-files-in-linux-command-line))

```
grep -rli 'old-word' . | xargs -i@ sed -i 's/old-word/new-word/g' @
```
